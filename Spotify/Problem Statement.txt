 Create the class Spotify with below attribute:

 spotifyId -int 
 profileName -String
 subscriptionType -String
 price -double
 groupSessionsAvailable -String

The above attributes must be private, write getters and setters and parametrized constructor as well.

Create public class Solution with main method.
Implement one static method: searchSpotifyPriceAvg in Solution class.

searchSpotifyPriceAvg() :
This method takes 3 input array of Spotify objects with String  subscriptionTypeCheck and String groupSessionsAvailableCheck  as input parameters.
This method will return the Average of price of Spotify objects where given String Parameters  subscriptionTypeCheck(String) and  groupSessionsAvailableCheck (String) matches with 
the actual attributes of Spotify objects.

All searches should be case insensitive.
For this method- The main method should print the Average as it is if returned value is not equal to zero. 
if returned value is zero then it print "No such users".

 Before calling this static method, use Scanner object to read the values of four Spotify
objects. No two Spotify Id will have same value. All the searches should be case insensitive.
then take two String input refering subscriptionTypeCheck and groupSessionsAvailableCheck.
then call searchSpotifyPriceAvg() method in main method.
